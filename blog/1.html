        <h1>Introspections as a Teaching Assistant</h1>
        <p>November 4, 2025</p>
        <p>As an undergraduate teaching assistant for both a Unix/networking and assembly class, I've had the opportunity to reflect on my experiences and collect my thoughts on some key insights that present and future TAs could benefit from.</p>

        <h3>Time Management is Important</h3>
        <p>Balancing coursework, extracurriculars, personal life, multi-disciplinary hobbies, and TA responsibilities can be a lot. I've made some key changes to my routine in order to have more time in the day to be productive. Some of these changes seem small, but usually aim to improve long-term productivity as well as short-term efficiency. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Separating work and leisure spaces both physically and mentally: Having a dedicated workspace and time for even just a few of my duties, and a dedicated space for doing absolutely nothing has done wonders for my productivity. Separating my work from my phone usage. Separating my coding from my reading. Separating my access from emails from my time in the gym etc... All of it helps to improve focus, as well as reduce the implicit cognitive load of switching from one task to another. This is a system that I've had to workshop with myself over and over for the past 3 years, and while not perfect, has improved my ability to sit down and get it done.</li>

            <li>Using a task management system, a planner. I use a combination of a physical planner from NIU as well as sticky notes throughout my day. Sometimes I get lost in my routine, neither slogging through the motions nor being hyper-productive. Having a planner to write down my tasks so that I can engage in short-term scheduling throughout the day has been wildly helpful.</li>
 
            <li>Getting rid of the damn smartphone. This is a big one. We use smartphones as emotional regulators. When we experience any host of low-arousal emotion such as loneliness, boredom, anxiety, or mild stress, we instinctually reach for the glowing rectangle of fun in our pockets. This habit, while disgustingly effective at emotional regulation, is a massive hindrance on overall productivity. It takes the cognitive load I mentioned in the first bullet-point, and multiplies it by a factor of 10. Every time you reach for your phone, you risk breaking the flow state you set out for yourself by planning and executing. That friction is simply too severe to ignore, so I ditched the smartphone, and operate entirely off of a flip phone now with surprisingly effective results. To see what phone I use, check out my gear section.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Mental Barriers are Important to Address</h3>
        <p>Productivity aside, there are some mental barriers outside of physical tasks that I had to conquer. I list them here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impostor syndrome: As a TA, you are expected to know more than the students you are assisting. Not only that, there's an implicit authority that comes with being a TA. Students look up to you as a beacon of knowledge and responsibility, when sometimes you are barely hanging on to the concepts you are supposed to be a master at. This is an inevitable reality, and discussing it with multiple other TAs has shown me that this is way more common than you would imagine. The answer to this is that you can do absolutely nothing about that feeling, and that is okay. Sometimes though, you experience "impostor syndrome" because you truly do not know the content you are teaching. In this instance, I would say that you should take the time to brush up on the material, and make sure you are comfortable with it.</li>

            <li>Setting boundaries: Not from personal experience since I helped with low-traffic courses, but from talking to other TAs, setting boundaries with the students and yourself is incredibly valuable. Telling students to format emails, and that you won't respond in a given time window are just a couple examples. This ties into the separation of work and leisure that I mentioned earlier.</li>

            <li>Emotional regulation: Being a TA can suck. Students can be rude, ungrateful, or so lost that you have to spend a LOT of time getting them back on track (if you care enough to do so). This is draining, and can very easily lead to burnout if you don't pay attention to yourself. The ability to abstract a technical topic into its higher-level detail in order to explain it to someone less technical is very computationally dense on your brain and can wear you out. Don't take things personally, take breaks when you need them, and do what you need to do to reset. The college semester is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, helping as a TA has been a rewarding experience. I've learned a lot about myself mentally, emotionally, and organizationally. I hope that these insights can help other TAs in their journey as well, or at the very least, be an entertaining read.</p>
